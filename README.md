# Face Recognition Project

## Project Overview
This project is a facial recognition system designed to process images and identify individuals using advanced machine learning techniques. Users can upload images through an intuitive Flask-based web interface, which integrates with a backend model to perform recognition tasks efficiently.

## Key Features
1. **Facial Recognition**: Detect and identify faces from uploaded images.
2. **Flask Integration**: A user-friendly web interface for image upload and result visualization.
3. **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a fine-tuned deep learning model for high accuracy.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Supports image processing and recognition directly from the web interface.

## Project Components
- **Frontend**: A simple and responsive Flask interface for user interaction.
- **Backend**: A machine learning model capable of recognizing faces from images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Flask framework

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/BriceZemba/Face-Recognition.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Face-Recognition
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```
3. Upload an image to perform face recognition.

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image via the web interface.
2. **Face Detection**: The system detects faces in the image using a pre-trained model.
3. **Face Recognition**: Identifies the person(s) in the image by comparing features with stored data.
4. **Results Display**: The results are displayed on the web interface with detailed information.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding real-time video feed recognition.
- Improving model accuracy with additional datasets.
- Integrating a database for storing and managing user data.
- Enhancing the web interface for better user experience.
